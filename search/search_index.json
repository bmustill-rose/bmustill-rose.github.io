Based on simple virbal feedback given by the tool, blind people are able to independantly position themselves appropriately in relation to their webcam before attending online meetings such that other sighted participants are able to see them. The tool uses on-device computer vision to determine the position of a users face within a frame. In non-technical terms this means that unlike some other services the images that your webcam captures (and by extension your face) is never sent to thirdparties. The tool came about due to a need to ensure that I have acceptable video quality during work meetings without having to resort to asking other participants, doubtless fostering all kinds of unconcious biases in the process. Many concepts have been lovingly borrowed from Apples Camera app on iOS / Mac OS; in fact in an ideal world the tool will hopefully gain enough traction in the community that Microsoft will see fit to implament similar functionality directly into Windows, therebye largely negating the need for it to exist.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#can-you-see-me","text":"Can You See Me is a simple tool that offers guidance on webcam placement to people with limited amounts of useful vision.

How to use Can You See Me has been designed for people who don't like reading manuals. Once opened the tool will very briefly instruct you on how to use all of its features accordingly: Press enter to hear an approximation of where your face is in the image (see below for an explanation of the feedback you will receive). Press p to take a photo of what your webcam can currently see (useful if you need to take a photo of yourself for whatever reason). The photo will be saved in the folder where Can You See Me is located. Press escape to exit. Understanding feedback Can You See Me devides what your webcam can see into a 5 by 5 grid in an effort to provide the most useful feedback possible. The first piece of feedback you will receive represents where your face is positioned virtically and the second where your face is positioned horizontally. Virtical positions are bottom, near the bottom, middle, near the top and top. Horizontal positions are left, slightly to the left, middle, slightly to the right and right. In practice, this means that you will receive pieces of feedback such as \"near the bottom and slightly to the left\", \"middle\" (which means your face is in the center of the grid) and \"near the top and slightly to the right\" to give some examples. If you find this confusing I'd suggest that you experiment by moving your upper body around in relation to your webcam and seeing what feedback you get for different positions. You should however bear in mind that depending on where you are positioned in relation to your webcam and on how adjustable your webcam is it may not be possible to position your face in every single position of the grid. NB: if after the feedback Can You See Me announces \"low confidence\" or \"very low confidence\" it has detected multiple faces within the image, which means that (unless there are multiple people in shot) the technology is incorrectly classifying something that it's seeing as a face. In this instance there is unfortunately no way of telling which of the faces it has found is the correct one or not.","title":"How To Use"},{"location":"how%20to%20use/#how-to-use","text":"This page contains some basic instructions around using the tool and understanding the feedback that it gives you.","title":"How To Use"},{"location":"how%20to%20use/#how-to-use_1","text":"Can You See Me has been designed for people who don't like reading manuals.
